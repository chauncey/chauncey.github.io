          <h4>Designed, implemented and maintained <small>a Linux server for PDF document generation using ReportLab, wkhtmltopdf, and Cyclone web server.</small></h4>
          <h4>Developed <small>a mobile site including payment processing and form generation</small></h4>
          <h4>Extended mobile site <small>into mobile apps for the iOS and Android platforms including setting up the store accounts, creating virtual machines for testing, and handling the submission process</small></h4>
          <h4>Designed, implemented and maintained <small>an endorsement web app that interfaced heavily with a legacy backend process. The challenges in this were to pull legacy data, track it on the app side but then send it to legacy programs for rating and then for making the changes. Part of the challenge in this were to detect endorsement quotes that could not be automatically applied and push them through a separate legacy process. This was all done with a goal of compatibility with the legacy backend while keeping the web app performant during the process.

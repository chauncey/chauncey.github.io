              <h2>Python</h2>
              <p>
                Python enables quick prototyping with a ton a useful modules in the standard library. It's a powerful language with an easy to read syntax. 
              </p>

              <h2>Cyclone</h2>
              <p>
                Built on Python's Twisted library to work like Tornado web server. I like that it's built on Twisted so that deep down you have a huge arsenal of goodies to use.
              </p>

            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h2>Flask</h2>
              <p>
                Python framework with all the MVC goodies without imposing a set structure. I find this a well though out framework that gives you the structure to build quickly without getting in your way.
              </p>

            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h2>Nodejs</h2>
              <p>
                Fast growing ecosystem with a language that's suited for frontend or backend development.

This was all done with a goal of compatibility with the legacy backend while keeping the web app performant during the process.</small></h4>
